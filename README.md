# FunCode
[Inprogress]-This is the current project I am working on. This is my University FYP project, in which I am creating an app for kids to learn basic coding concepts through visuals. Kids can learn about variables, loops, and conditional statements by performing drag-and-drop actions.

# Objective
1. Motivate Kids to Learn to Code
2. Boost Problem Solving Skill
3. Imrpove Decision Making Ability

# Game Modes
# Varialbe
Player learn about different variable data types like Int, float and string. Player can drag and drop the numbers and alphabets into the Box object to learn about each data type.

# IF-Else
[Inprogress] Player learn if-else concept by completing the current order. Player drag and drop the balls in if statement and if the color of the ball matches the color of if statement then if statement will execute and if color is not matched then else statement will execute.
